This a wechat mini-program for data collection. It implements four different psychological tests. One can share his/her result
with another people and the similarity between them will then be calculated. Besides, the mini-program can generate QRcode so that the 
user can share the picture in his/her moment. The user can know from the result about his/her personality and even the job that fits 
him/her most. The program has been published and the collection of data is in the process.
